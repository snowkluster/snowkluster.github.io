        <p>Moving on to the next batch of war rooms, the challenges get a bit more technical and a bit more fun. So
            let&#39;s continue, shall we…</p>
    
        <h2 id="level-06">LEVEL 06</h2>
        <p><strong>Natas6</strong> start us off by asking for a secret password and if we enter the wrong password it gives
            us an error message.</p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas-6-home.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>if we view the source we can see the verification function that is used here, and we can see that it in the
            <code>PHP</code> code it includes a file called <code>/includes/secret.inc</code> if we visit the page in our
            browser we see an empty page but viewing the source reveals the password need to pass verification
            <code>FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU</code>. When we enter the secret in the homepage, and we get the password required to
            access the next room.</p>
        <p>The password is <code>jmxSiH3SP6Sonf8dv66ng8v1cIEdjXWr</code>.</p>
    
        <h2 id="level-07">LEVEL 07</h2>
        <p>When we first connect to the page, we see two links that leads to</p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas7-home.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas7-about.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>When we view the page source for both these pages, we see a comment left behind, giving us a hint.</p>
        <p><code>hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8</code></p>
        <p>We also see that when we click on any of the hyperlinks, the URL of the page changes to </p>
        <p><code>index.php?page=home</code>.</p>
        <p>This could mean that these pages are loaded in using an include function in <code>PHP</code> and that could lead
            us to a <strong>local file inclusion vulnerability</strong></p>
        <p>If we enter the file path that the clue gave us, it leads to a new page giving us the next password.</p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas7-pass.png" alt=""></p>
    
        <h2 id="level-08">LEVEL 08</h2>
        <p>Level 8 starts off similar to level 6 asking us for a password. Viewing the source shows us the verification
            method used.</p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas8-encode.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>We can see that it takes our password, does a few operations on it and then compares it to the
            <code>$encodedSecret = &quot;3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362&quot;</code>.</p>
        <p>So to crack the password if simply perform the operations in reverse order on the <code>$encodedSecret</code>.
        </p>
        <p>Firstly we convert the <code>$encodedSecret&quot;</code> from <code>bin2hex</code> then reverse the string that
            we get and finally decode the <code>base64</code> output leaving us with the</p>
        <p>secret <code>oubWYf2kBq</code> and the password to next level <code>Sda6t0vkOPkM8YeOZkAGVhFoaplvlJFd</code>.</p>
    
        <h2 id="level-09">LEVEL 09</h2>
        <p>This room is a great example to learn about command injections. The homepage contains a search box which returns
            all the string that match the user entered string.</p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas9-home.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Viewing the source shows us that the search function essentially runs the Linux command
            <code>passthru(&quot;grep -i $key dictionary.txt&quot;);</code> on the given user string using the
            <code>PHP</code> command <code>passthru</code>, this is the key to cracking this room. As the
            <code>passthru</code> function does no check on the user input, we can use it to run our own commands. To run
            multiple commands on Linux simultaneously, we use the <code>;</code> symbol telling the shell that the command
            following the <code>;</code> symbol need to execute regardless of the success of the first command. By doing
            this, we can view all the files and folders present on the machine.</p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas9-all-files.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>We know from the <strong>Natas</strong> start page that
            <code>All passwords are also stored in /etc/natas_webpass/</code> so we can go to file location
            <code>/etc/natas_webpass/natas10</code> to get the password to the next room. We can use the payload
            <code>; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10</code> to view the contents of the file <strong>natas10</strong>. This
            gets us the password for the next room <code>D44EcsFkLxPIkAAKLosx8z3hxX1Z4MCE</code>. To make the output of our
            payload cleaner we can use the <code>#</code> symbol that is used to trim string and comment out the rest of
            command output (which in our case the output of the command <code>grep -i $key dictionary.txt</code>)</p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas9-fin-pay.png" alt=""></p>
    
        <h2 id="level-10">LEVEL 10</h2>
        <p>This level is pretty similar to level nine but with more security features. Now before our query gets passed to
            the <code>passthru</code> function it is checked against regex to see if there are illegal characters in use
            <code>if(preg_match(&#39;/[;|&amp;]/&#39;,$key))</code>. To circumvent this, we can use skip the use of
            <code>; cat</code> and directly exploit the function, as it still use grep. We can pass a query like
            <code>.* /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 #</code> telling grep to get the content of the file natas11 located at
            given directory and ignore the rest of output (this will shorten our result as the output of grep -i dictionary
            is droped by bash).
        </p>
        <p>Therefore the key is <code>1KFqoJXi6hRaPluAmk8ESDW4fSysRoIg</code></p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas10-ans.png" alt=""></p>
    
        <h2 id="level-11">LEVEL 11</h2>
        <p>From this level onwards, the challenges focus on more complex topics and exploits. For this challenge, we are
            given a text box in accepts hex colour values and changes the background colour accordingly. </p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas11-home.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Looking at the source code, we see an array declared at the start,</p>
        <p><code>$defaultdata = array( &quot;showpassword&quot;=&gt;&quot;no&quot;, &quot;bgcolor&quot;=&gt;&quot;#ffffff&quot;);</code>
        </p>
        <p>Followed by three functions.</p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas11-src.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Analysing the source code, we see that the <code>loaddata</code> function is passed the <code>defaultdata</code>
            array, the function sets a global cookie and passes the value of <code>defaultdata</code> to
            <code>mydata</code>. It then checks the cookie to see if it&#39;s an array and that this array contains a key
            value called data. If data exists then the key value of data from the cookie is decoded from base64 passed to
            the XOR function and then finally decoded from JSON as the XOR function would return PHP code and stored in
            <code>tempdata</code>. Check are then made to see if <code>tempdata</code> is an array and that it contains the
            keys <code>showpassword</code> and <code>bgcolor</code> and that <code>bgcolor</code> is not greater than 6
            characters.</p>
        <p>If the conditions are met, the value of <code>mydata</code> is changed and returned. The save data function sets
            the cookie via,</p>
        <p><code>setcookie(&quot;data&quot;, base64_encode(xor_encrypt(json_encode($d))));</code></p>
        <p>This leaves us with the final function to analyse the <code>xor_encrypt</code> function. It takes the array
            passed to it and XOR each element of the array with the elements of the key is the following way:</p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas11-xor.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>So to get the password to the next level, we need to set the array key value of <strong>showpassword</strong> to
            <strong>yes</strong>. We know that the value for the array is read from the cookie and that the cookie is XOR
            encrypted. But XOR is a flawed encryption technique as, if one know any two of the values used in the function,
            they are able to derive the third value.</p>
        <p><strong>Plaintext ⊕ key = encrypted_text</strong></p>
        <p><strong>encrypted_text ⊕ plaintext = key</strong></p>
        <p><strong>encrypted_text ⊕ key = plaintext</strong></p>
        <p>Where ⊕ denotes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_disjunction">exclusive disjunction</a> (XOR)
            operation.</p>
        <p>We can see the current cookie by typing <code>document.cookie</code> into the console, this gives the value of
            <strong>&quot;data=MGw7JCQ5OC04PT8jOSpqdmkgJ25nbCorKCEkIzlscm5oKC4qLSgubjY%3D&quot;</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Since all cookies are URL encoded by the web server, we first need to decode it from the URL format. We can
            further see from the <code>loaddata</code> function that this value need to be decoded from Base64 before
            passing it to the XOR function. </p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas11-url-b64.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Now, to find the key used in the XOR function which is censored in the given source code, </p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas11-censor.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>we first need to take the decode output and pass that as an input to the XOR function. For the key, we need to
            pass the value of the array that&#39;s stored in the cookie, as that&#39;s the Plain text.</p>
        <p><code>$defaultdata = array( &quot;showpassword&quot;=&gt;&quot;no&quot;, &quot;bgcolor&quot;=&gt;&quot;#ffffff&quot;);</code>
        </p>
        <p>But these values are stored as PHP code, to get the real Plain text value we need to encode it to JSON like in
            the save data function. Doing this will lend us the real key used in the XOR cipher as, </p>
        <p><strong>encrypted_text ⊕ plaintext = key</strong></p>
        <p>The key Being <strong>KNHLKNHLKNHLKNHLKNHLKNHLKNHLKNHLKNHLKNHLK</strong>, but this isn&#39;t the real key, as we
            can see the value <strong>KNHL</strong> is being repeated over and over again this happens when the keys used in
            XOR is shorter than the Plain text. So the real key is <strong>KNHL</strong></p>
        <p>Now, using this key we can forge a new cookie where the value <code>showpassword</code> is set to true and then
            all we need to do to get the flag is inject this malformed cookie and refresh the page.
            Given us the password to next level <code>YWqo0pjpcXzSIl5NMAVxg12QxeC1w9QG</code></p>

        <h2 id="level-12">LEVEL 12</h2>
        <p>This level is the start to us learning about file upload vulnerabilities, We start off at the home page where we
            can upload a JPEG with the max size of 1 KB, </p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas12-home.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>but we can upload any file to it as there are no checks present on the website. However, uploading a PHP file to
            the site, gives it a random name, changes its extension to <strong>&quot;.jpg&quot;</strong> and places it in
            the <strong>/upload/</strong> directory.</p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas12-up.png" alt=""></p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas12-src.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>We can see from the source code that, when a file is uploaded via POST request with the name “filename”, and the
            file is smaller than 1000B. A random string of length 10 with small-case alphanumeric characters as substitute
            for the original filename is created. Finally, the file is uploaded to &quot;upload/[10 character random
            alphanumeric filename].jpg&quot; </p>
        <p>However, if after selecting our file we intercept the upload request using Burp, we see that we are able to
            change the file-type of the file. Specially the form-data with the name &quot;<strong>filename</strong>&quot; ,
            changing the auto added <strong>.jpg</strong> extension to <strong>.php</strong> we can run our code on the
            server.</p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas12-burp.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>With the following PHP code, we should be able to cat out the password to the next level </p>
        <p><img src="/static/Blog3/natas12-mal.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>To do so, we upload the crafted PHP file but intercept the request to change the auto added <strong>.jpg</strong>
            to <strong>.php</strong> so that our code can execute. Doing this gives us the upload endpoint where our PHP
            file resides, visiting the endpoint triggers our code to execute and gives use the password to the next level:
            <code>lW3jYRI02ZKDBb8VtQBU1f6eDRo6WEj9</code></p>
        <h2 id="finishing-off">Finishing OFF</h2>
        <p>I will be posting the solutions to natas13 through natas18, hopefully soon...</p>
