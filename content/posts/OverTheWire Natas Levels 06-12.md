# More To Learn

Moving on to the next batch of war rooms, the challenges get a bit more technical and a bit more fun. So let's continue, shall weâ€¦

## LEVEL 06

**Natas6** start us off by asking for a secret password and if we enter the wrong password it gives us an error message.

if we view the source we can see the verification function that is used here, and we can see that it in the ``PHP`` code it includes a file called ``/includes/secret.inc`` if we visit the page in our browser we see an empty page but viewing the source reveals the password need to pass verification ``FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU``. When we enter the secret in the homepage, and we get the password required to access the next room.

The password is ``jmxSiH3SP6Sonf8dv66ng8v1cIEdjXWr``.

## LEVEL 07

When we first connect to the page, we see two links that leads to

and

When we view the page source for both these pages, we see a comment left behind, giving us a hint.

``hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8``

We also see that when we click on any of the hyperlinks, the URL of the page changes to 

``index.php?page=home``.

This could mean that these pages are loaded in using an include function in ``PHP`` and that could lead us to a **local file inclusion vulnerability**

If we enter the file path that the clue gave us, it leads to a new page giving us the next password.

## LEVEL 08

Level 8 starts off similar to level 6 asking us for a password. Viewing the source shows us the verification method used.

![](/Blog3/natas8-encode.png)

We can see that it takes our password, does a few operations on it and then compares it to the ``$encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362"``.

So to crack the password if simply perform the operations in reverse order on the ``$encodedSecret``.

Firstly we convert the ``$encodedSecret"`` from ``bin2hex`` then reverse the string that we get and finally decode the ``base64`` output leaving us with the

secret ``oubWYf2kBq`` and the password to next level ``Sda6t0vkOPkM8YeOZkAGVhFoaplvlJFd``.

## LEVEL 09

This room is a great example to learn about command injections. The homepage contains a search box which returns all the string that match the user entered string.

![](/Blog3/natas9-home.png)

Viewing the source shows us that the search function essentially runs the Linux command ``passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");`` on the given user string using the ``PHP`` command ``passthru``, this is the key to cracking this room. As the ``passthru`` function does no check on the user input, we can use it to run our own commands. To run multiple commands on Linux simultaneously, we use the ``;`` symbol telling the shell that the command following the ``;`` symbol need to execute regardless of the success of the first command. By doing this, we can view all the files and folders present on the machine.

![](/Blog3/natas9-all-files.png)

We know from the **Natas** start page that ``All passwords are also stored in /etc/natas_webpass/`` so we can go to file location ``/etc/natas_webpass/natas10`` to get the password to the next room. We can use the payload ``; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10`` to view the contents of the file __natas10__. This gets us the password for the next room ``D44EcsFkLxPIkAAKLosx8z3hxX1Z4MCE``. To make the output of our payload cleaner we can use the ``#`` symbol that is used to trim string and comment out the rest of command output (which in our case the output of the command ``grep -i $key dictionary.txt``)

## LEVEL 10

This level is pretty similar to level nine but with more security features. Now before our query gets passed to the ``passthru`` function it is checked against regex to see if there are illegal characters in use ``if(preg_match('/[;|&]/',$key))``. To circumvent this, we can use skip the use of ``; cat`` and directly exploit the function, as it still use grep. We can pass a query like 
``.* /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 #`` telling grep to get the content of the file natas11 located at given directory and ignore the rest of output (this will shorten our result as the output of grep -i dictionary is droped by bash).

Therefore the key is ``1KFqoJXi6hRaPluAmk8ESDW4fSysRoIg``
