# New Beginning's

After much slacking off, I have finally moved the site over to a new theme and a fresh look. The old holy theme for Hugo was pretty good, but after some time it looked pretty dated. The new theme used for the site is Poison, which is based on the old Hyde theme, it looks great and feels fresh.

## Future Plan's

I do plan to finish the NATAS series in the coming month's so that we can move on to newer challenges like **hackmyvm** or even blogs about Bug Bounty Programs that I am doing.

Until Next time...git
