# Hi 
I'm __Rohan Kaushik__ or as I go by my online alias **Snow-Kluster**.
You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/snow-kluster) and on [DEV](https://dev.to/snowkluster).

I am currently computer science student with a passion in cyber security 👾. Having played a few CTFs, I am a amateur CTF ⛳ player and a privacy enthusiast 🔏, that has been trying to catch a Big Bounty.

When it comes to working tools, I'm a Linux power-user, an Vim enthusiast 🐱‍💻, and a recent Neovim refugee 😂. I'm always on the lookout for ways to streamline my workflow and increase my productivity, so if you have any tips or tricks you'd like to share, I'd love to hear them! 🙌.


If you're interested in connecting with me, please feel free to check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/snow-kluster), or my [Mastodon profile](https://infosec.exchange/@kluster ). I'm always looking to network with other developers, learn new things, and collaborate on exciting projects 👩‍💻.
